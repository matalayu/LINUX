How do I install my local rpm files using yum?
==============================================

Use the command yum localinstall /path/to/file.rpm. 
This command will install the local rpm file as well as searching for required rpms (dependencies, etc) 
on RHN or other repositories that are configured and install it for the user.


  # yum localinstall /path/to/file.rpm

  # yum localinstall ./*
